## Lessons Learned

In this project I continued developing my skills in handing off data from one scene to another. Transferring the calculated result to display in another scene than the input scene was a little challenging. To overcome this challenge, I had to use prepare() to set some properties of the destination view controller prior to the segue being performed.
